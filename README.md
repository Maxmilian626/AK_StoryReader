# AK_StoryViewer for GamePress
This is the source code for the Arknights Story Viewer on GamePress.

Assets are stored on the GamePress.gg domain, and thus the story viewer references them on-site as opposed to storing them locally.

In addition to the normal Visual Novel functions (i.e. reading and decision-making), this viewer also has the option to go backwards in order to backtrack or choose another branch.
